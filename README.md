# SDL2 Pong Game
A simple pong game created using C++ and SDL2 libraries. 

## In Order to Run
You will need to install SDL2 libraries (SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf) to the main "include" directory on your machine. You can also add the libraries directly to the 'sdl2pong' folder directly, but you will need to edit the headers in the game.hpp file.
